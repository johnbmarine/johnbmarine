- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnbmarine
- 👀 I am interested in trying to build a static HTML website and a pack of sites as best as I can.
- 🌱 I am currently learning how to use GitHub as well as trying things like W3.CSS and later maybe learning Bootstrap.
- 💞️ I am not looking to collaborate on anything right now.  I mostly work alone.
- 📫 How to reach me- the social media platform I am most accepting of is my Facebook fan page.  So check me out on https://www.facebook.com/TheJohnMarine .
