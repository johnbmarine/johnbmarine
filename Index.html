  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to my site!</h1>
</div>

<div class="w3-container">
  <p>Greetings!  My name is John.  This is the start of a new chapter trying to come up with creative content.  I am working to try to get this site up and going.  This site will be vastly modified with new content as I get around to producing extra content.  So join me on my journey and have fun!
  </p>
  
  <p>Where can I take you today/tonight?  ;)</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">What is this Site?</h1>
  <p>To practice making static HTML websites, I developed this site.  In no way am I adept in frontend web design.&nbsp; I basically learned this by going around on some website.  I did once attempt to design a practice layout, but never made it available for sale or review.</p><br><br>
  
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Work in Progress!</h1>
  <p>Like life, this site evolves and changes over time.  So what you see here today may be different tomorrow!  Surely you want to stick around to see this site evolve once I get going.  The ultimate goal is to build my own static website that is as detailed the blogs I run.  Blogs?  Sure!  Check out the next section...</p><br><br>
  
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Blogging</h1>
  <p>My primary trade is blogging.  I used to blog a lot on Myspace when Myspace was still popular in its day.  I later decided to start a blog on the Blogger/Blogspot platform.  If you were to read my Blogger profile, it will say that I have been blogging since May 2007.  However, I did not post my very first blog post on my main blog until January 2009.  I have blogged ever since and even established five other blogs (one of which discontinued) on the Blogger/Blogspot platform.  I have enjoyed having an international audience view my blogging work over the years.  Since 2009 or so, I have gotten blog hits from many countries- at least 180 different countries.  As someone who loves stars and space, I adopted a theme of stars and space to my blog names.</p>
    <p>If you would like to visit any or all of my blogs, I invite you to click on the "visit" links below each blog's description.  And in case you're wondering, the headings and text are close approximations of each blog's official colors or themes.  The included hashtags are for finding each blog on social media.</p><br>

  <h2>John's Blog Space - #JohnsBlogSpace</h2>
  <p>"Johns Blog Space" is the main blog and the main thoroughfare for all of my blogging content.  This is no niche blog.  My main blog is about two things- anything and everything.  Material expressed are all of my own opinion.  However, there are also some guest posts for those who want to put their work on my blog for the world to see.  The officially-recognized establishment date of "John's Blog Space" is January 23, 2009.</p>

  <h2>John's Creative Space - #JohnsCS</h2>
  <p>To showcase my creative works and to discuss certain items and topics regarding creative work, I have established "John's Creative Space" on March 24, 2014.  You can take a look at a lot of my own creative work on that site.  I discuss some of my own works.</p>

  <h2>John's Race Space - #JohnsRaceSpace</h2>
    <p>As a racing game fan, I originally started this blog as "John's Gran Turismo Space" on November 16, 2010.  It was a blog whose roots were about discussing the Gran Turismo series and Tourist Trophy.  I made a decision in November 21, 2013 to re-brand the blog as "John's Race Space," and thereafter devote my time and energy to other racing games and various driving games as well.  This blog has become the blog in which I discuss all things racing games and driving games, even including the Gran Turismo series and Tourist Trophy.  If this is your favorite genre of games, then I surely welcome you to my racing/driving game blog.  Don't be afraid... dive right in!</p>

  <h2>StyleSpace, by John B. Marine - #SSbyJBM</h2>
    <p>On July 7, 2012, I established my fashion/beauty blog.  Originally to be named "StyleSpace," the blog name at the time was already taken on Blogger/Blogspot.  The blog goes under two names: "StyleSpace, by John B. Marine" (official) and "StyleSpace by JBM."  Do NOT visit the blog thinking you're going to get things like giveaways, fashion tips, fashion show coverage, and things like that.  Most of what I blog about in regards to fashion are all based on thoughts and impressions.  That's why I label it as an unconventional fashion blog.  As a bonus, I often like to post widgets liking you to relevant fashion items in regards to the topics expressed in my fashion/beauty blog.  I even go as far as to salute other bloggers in the category.  So there is something for everyone who even cares one iota about fashion/beauty.</p>

  <h2>John's Life Space - #JohnsLifeSpace</h2>
    <p>The life issues blog of mine is called "John's Life Space."  It was created as a blog to express thoughts of mine regarding various life issues.  The most popular element of my life issues blog is my "Helpful Resources" page, which features many online resources designed for visitors to get the needed help regarding any number of life issues.  "John's Life Space" is my youngest blog.  It was established in November 8, 2017; and it is also dedicated in loving memory of my late grandmother.</p>
